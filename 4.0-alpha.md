# Changes from the previous version
- eliminate the polygonal approximation
- no need for accurate baseline normalization
  - Simple LSTM still depends on good input size/position.
  - DN can be designed to learn normalization but trains slowly.

# Tesseract LSTM and Tensor Flow
- Tesseract LSTM (T-LSTM) came first, and only supports sequence
processing
- Tensor Flow is built for speed, on batches of fixed-size input, but can be
run from Tesseract. --> Google is working on it since 2016.
- An entire TF graph is treated as a Tesseract Network element.
- TF graph must be designed to support variable width inputs, or work only
on fixed-size images.
